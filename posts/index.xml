One of the tasks internally was to design and create a package which read common csv files for the company, as a NuGet package, so it could be used across internal company tools.

If you choose to build your portfolio site using only HTML and CSS, you may run into the issue of repetitive code.
Example: Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a blog post called my-blog-post.html and you want to create another post.

Both libraries are widely used in the web development community and have a strong following among developers.

Web development in C# (while I understand why some people hate it), is actually quite a painless process, everything seems to fit together nicely if you understand most of the concepts before starting a project.
