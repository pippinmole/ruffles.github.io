It is influenced by the Mario Kart franchise, and <strong>supports multiplayer and game controllers</strong>.</p><p>The project sample can be found here: <a href=https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/fusion/current/samples/game-samples/fusion-karts>https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/fusion/current/samples/game-samples/fusion-karts</a></p><h3 id=the-story>The Story</h3><p>It started off when I saw that Dan and Hucota were looking for somebody to help with adding multiplayer to their game. Since I had past experience in multiplayer programming, I took the job. We started with <a href=https://www.photonengine.com/bolt>Photon Bolt</a> as our networking solution, as I was most familiar with Bolt.</p><p>As time progressed, we found out that the physics simulation in Bolt wasn&rsquo;t up to spec with what we wanted. When the player&rsquo;s kart would collide with other karts, it would jitter and cause all sorts of issues which even the developers of Bolt couldn&rsquo;t help us with.</p><p>Nonetheless, we progressed through with the migration and had a few playtests. Not everything worked, but we got driving networked. This was one of our first running instances:</p><p><img src=/img/fusion-kart/bolt-first-playtest.gif alt="Gif of Kart Bolt playtest"></p><p>It was about this time that one of the Photon team suggested to us that we use their new networking package, <a href=https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/fusion/current/getting-started/fusion-intro>Photon Fusion</a>, and that they would pay us to create a sample for them to put on their website! Bingo! They promised better physics interactions, and easier workflow, and of course, we took the offer.</p><p>This was new technology to us, and so we had to get used to this new workflow. It was quite different to Bolt, however it was trivial to get a test project working + we even got a physic test working on the first day.</p><p><img src=/img/fusion-kart/fusion-first-playtest.gif alt="Gif of first Fusion Kart playtest">
